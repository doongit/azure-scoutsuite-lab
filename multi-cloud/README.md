# 🌐 Multi-Cloud Audit — ScoutSuite

This section shows **AWS & GCP** scans alongside Azure to demonstrate cross-cloud security posture skills.

## Contents
- `aws/aws-scoutsuite-demo.md` — how to run & what to document on AWS
- `gcp/gcp-scoutsuite-demo.md` — how to run & what to document on GCP
- `compare-azure-aws-gcp.md` — side-by-side findings + control mapping

## Why this matters
- Recruiters want **multi-cloud** security awareness (not just Azure).
- Shows CSPM fundamentals, identity hardening, storage security, and logging across providers.
- Sets you up to add **IaC guardrails** (Terraform policy, OPA/Checkov) later.
